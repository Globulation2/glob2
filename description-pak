innovative state-of-the-art Real Time Strategy (RTS) game
 Globulation 2, in a whole, is an on-going project to create an innovative high
 quality gameplay by minimizing micro-management and assigning automatically
 the tasks to the units.  The player just has to order the number of units
 he wants for a selected task and the units will do their best to satisfy
 his requirements.
 .
 Glob2 can be played by a single player, through your Local Area Network (LAN),
 or through Internet, thanks to Ysagoon Online Game (YOG), a meta-server.  It
 also features a scripting language for versatile gameplay and an integrated
 map editor.
