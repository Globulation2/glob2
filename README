This game is still in heavy development:
- graphics are not definitive
- there is a lot of debug output
- display is slow
- it crashes sometimes

If you get a crash, submit a bug report with the last lines of the output as well as the log files (in ${HOME}/.glob2/log) as attachement.
Please use Savannah (http://sv.gnu.org/projects/glob2) for bug reports.


GNU and UNIX

If you have taken this from CVS and you want to build the package,
run the bootstrap script first (you might use autoreconf if you have it).

Then read the INSTALL file.

Note : if SDL is not installed system wide but rather in $prefix,
add the following flags to aclocal :
aclocal -I $prefix/share/aclocal


MacOS X

Replace aclocal by
aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal


Microsoft Windows

To build the data files, run makedata.bat in the data subdirectory, then use glob2.dsw
with MSDEV to build glob2.


!! WARNING !!
The gfx are no more included in the CVS.
To get them, run the getgfx script.


Have fun,
