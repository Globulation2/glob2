Globulation 2

Under UNIX :

If you have taken this from CVS and you want to build the package,
run the bootstrap script first.

Then read the INSTALL file.

Note : if SDL is not installed system wide but rather in $prefix,
add the following flags to aclocal :
aclocal -I $prefix/share/aclocal

Under macOSX, replace aclocal by
aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal

It doesn't currently work with automake 1.6 You should install automake 1.4 (in /usr/local/bin) and start it from there.

With the current version of SDL, the fullScreen doesn't work with double buffering. Disable it with "-f -B".

Under Win32 :

To build the data files, run makedata.bat in the data subdirectory, then use glob2.dsw
with MSDEV to build glob2.

!! WARNING !!
The gfx are no more included in the CVS.
To get the, run the getgfx script.

Have fun
