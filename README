This game is still in heavy development, so consider that:
- the graphics are not definitive,
- there is a lot of debug output,
- it's slow,
- it crashes sometimes.

If you get a crash, submit a bug report with the last lines of the output as
well as the log files (in ${HOME}/.glob2/log) as attachement.
Please use Savannah (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/glob2) for bug reports.

If you got the source from CVS, read README.cvs first.


GNU and UNIX

Have fun,
