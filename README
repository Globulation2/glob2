Globulation 2

Under UNIX :

If you have taken this from CVS and you want to build the package;
type this in the same directory as this file :

autoheader && aclocal && automake --add-missing && autoconf

Then read the INSTALL file.

Note : if SDL is not installed system wide but rather in $prefix,
add the following flags to aclocal :
aclocal -I $prefix/share/aclocal

Under Win32 :

To build the data file,s run makedata.bat in the data subdirectory, then use glob2.dsw
with MSDEV to build glob2.

!! WARNING !!
The gfx are no more included in the CVS.
You have to go to download them at
http://moneo.calodox.org/~nct/glob2gfx.tar

Once downloaded, untar them in the data directory :
cd glob2/data, tar xvf glob2gfx.tar

Have fun
