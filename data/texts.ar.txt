[YOG_HELP]
The YOG messaging system has two commands, "msg" and "away". Type "/help <command>" to learn more about one of them.
[YOG_HELP_AWAY]
The "/away (<message>)" command allows you to let the other YOG users know that you are temporarily away.  You may add a short explanation message.  For instance "/away I'm eating a hamburger and I'll be back at 1 o'clock". Alias "/a"
[YOG_HELP_MSG]
The "/msg <name> <message>" command sends a private message.  For instance, "/msg John Hi John, how are you?".  Alias "/m".
