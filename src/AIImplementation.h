/*
What's in AI ?
AI represents teh behaviour of an artificial intelligence player.
The main methode is Order *getOrder() which return the order to be used by the AI's team.
*/

#include "BuildingType.h"

class Player;
class Order;

/*
Howto make a new AI ?
If you want to build a new way AI behave, you have to:
Add a new Strategy to the below enum.
Add a new if in the getOrder methode.
Add a new case in the load and save methodes.
Fill these methodes correctly.

Warning:
You have to understand Order's mechanism.
Never uses rand() but allways syncRand().
(because the AI need to behave exactly the same on every computers.)
Be sure to return at least a *NullOrder, not NULL.

Idea:
You can access usefull data this way:
player
player->team
player->team->game
player->team->game->map

Fairness:
AI don't have restriction access to hidden part of the map.
You have to check it yourself, please do it.
Please don't uses too much CPU too.
Test games with a lot of AI that for.

Gameplay:
Player and AI may play together, in the same team.
Think if your AI is able to play with another human player ?
