What's in NetGame ?

NetGame is used by the engine to push and pop order for every players.
(local players, AIs and remote players)

Without latency, it could be a simple list of Orders, one for each player.

But the aim of NetGame is to hide the latency (and lost orders)
for all the rest of the engine and the program.
Then, for each player, you have a queue of order.
Even if you are not playing network games, locals players and AIs, allways have n="latency" orders in queue.
You have 0 to 2*"latency" order for remote players. (With or without gaps)
Some order may be missing, because network layer (UDP) may have lost them.
At playersNetQueue[player][currentStep] you have all orders that have to be executed this turn.
But if only one is missing, the engine must NOT execute any of them. (I mean NO order at all).
Therefore, if one ore more is missig "Order *getOrder(Sint32 playerNumber)"
will return a "WatingForPlayerOrder" for all player.
This way the engine is protected from exectutng order asynchronously.

void pushOrder(Order *order, Sint32 playerNumber) has fo be called for each AI and the local player.

int advance() represents the time to wait because your computer has probably
executed mor orders than other other computer playing the same game.
This is totaly pragamtic, and it need to be ehanced. The engine has to call
it and slow the game if needed.

NetGame also have to drop player if he is definitely unreachable.
int countDown[32] is used that for.

NetGame is not TCP/IP friendly.
I'm really sorry, but I'm not yet able to design this.

The engine has to call NetGame::step() to give him time to process.

/*
conventions:
-default timing unit is a tick. 1[t]=40[ms]
-all iterators take a "i" suffix. ("pi"=player iterator, "si"=step iterator, "di"=delay iterator, "ri"=recent iterator)

assertions:
-No game will last longer than 5.4 years (2^32*40[ms]), or user will take time to save it before :P

order's steps tricks:
-"usteps" are Uint32 uniques tick identifiers.
-(ustep==0) means no order. (exception for the very first unsent order, which nobody cares).
-Lowers bits of usteps are used as a hash to store orders in "ordersQueue".
-All orders are kept in memory trough "ordersQueue" until another mor recent order has the same hash.
-computeNumberOfStepsToEat() should compute "numberOfStepsToEat==1",
	except when latency is increased (numberOfStepsToEat==0), or decreased (numberOfStepsToEat==2).
