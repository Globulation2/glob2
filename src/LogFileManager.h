/*!
The LogFileManager is an utility class. It's designed to have only one instance per programm.
Simply call the class method "getFile()" like you would call the C function "fopen()".
The returned "FILE*" is writeable, and stored in a place choosed by the "FileManager*" policy.

The name of the file is the concathenation of the user name and the "const char *fileName" argument.
This is usefull when you have to test multiple users on the same account while debugging multiplayers games.

If you request the same file name more than once, the LogFileManager will give you a pointer "FILE*"
to the same file, without opening nor closing any file.
This way we can have all log data of all instances of the same class in the same file.
