Globulation 2 Installation Instructions
=======================================


Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `scons' to build the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh scons' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `scons' itself.

     Running `scons' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which source files it is compiling.

  2. When compiled, type (probably as root) `scons install' to install
     the programs and any data files and documentation.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `scons -c'.


Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `scons' script does not know about.  Run `scons --help'
for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `scons' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     scons CXXFLAGS=" -g -pg" INSTALLDIR="/usr/local/share/games"

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `scons install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin' and `/usr/local/share'.  You can specify installation
paths other than `/usr/local/*' by giving `scons' the options `INSTALLDIR'
and `BINDIR'. If you wanted to install into your home directory for example
(if you dont have permissions for root installtion), you would run:

     scons BINDIR="/home/user/glob2/bin" INSTALLDIR="/home/user/glob2/share"

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   `scons' will work on must Unix/Linux systems. However, to compile on windows,
the flag `mingw=true' must be called. More information on compiling on Windows can
be found at http://globulation2.org/wiki/Mingw_compilation
