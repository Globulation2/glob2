<h1>Translations tool</h1>
<ol>
<li>Be patient! On some browsers this application takes quite some time to load.</li>
<li>Play around and report bugs to <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=glob2">our bugtracker</a></li>
<li>Initially you see only the keys to be translated. It is not a bad idea to klick the "en" button as the english translation is the most complete one normally.</li>
<li>If the key contains %0, %1, ... those symbols must be in the translation, too as they are wildcards for content that is added at runtime.</li>
<li>This tool does not require a login. Still it is protected against vandalism to a degree as you can store states of modification to our versioning control system by clicking "store changes".</li>
<li>If you want to be mentioned in the <b>List Of Contributors</b> please provide both your name and a mail adress in the "store changes"-dialogue.</li>
