# Core unit animation sprites

The game uses 32 poses for each of eight directions in seven animation sets.
It still advances simulation and rendering on its existing schedule (25 Hz at
normal speed). This asset change does not increase the display refresh rate.

`render.py` records the seven source files, legacy action bases, native output
sizes, and presence of a separate shadow pass. The order is explorer flight,
worker walk/swim/harvest, then warrior walk/swim/fight. Building shares harvest.

## Renderer

Use the official Blender **2.34 Linux i386 static** release. Blender 2.79 changes
the orthographic projection and surface rendering; even corrected camera
projection does not reproduce the warrior's surface detail. Blender 2.34 uses
the source rigs, materials, lights, gamma/alpha encoding, and shadow passes
directly. No animation channels are removed or modified. The explorer camera
is shifted half a pixel left/down in image space to match the shipped sprites;
all other cameras are unchanged.

On Apple Silicon, run this 32-bit Linux executable in a Linux container with
`qemu-i386`. It requires i386 libc, X11/Xmu/Xi/Xext, OpenGL/GLU, SDL 1.2, and the
legacy `libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3`. The latter is available in Debian's archived
`libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2_2.95.4-27_i386.deb`. Extract its libraries into a private
directory and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the renderer; do not replace system libs.
The renderer does not require a display or a working Python 2 installation.
Its missing-Python-library startup messages are harmless for `-b ... -a`.

## Generate

Use a temporary output directory, mounted at `/work` in the rendering container.
Run the host-side commands from the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/unit-animation/render.py prepare \
  --output /path/to/work/scenes32 --render-root /work/render32
```

The script copies each `.blend` and changes only the scene's frame mapping,
render start/end, and output directory, plus the explorer camera alignment. Its
DNA parser verifies that no other bytes change. Original frame `t` is sampled at output frame `4*t`; the intervening
three frames evaluate the original animation at quarter-frame intervals.
Direction and shadow-pass changes remain on the original timeline. The sources
use constant (stepped) interpolation for the direction rotation and pass
switches, and cyclic gait curves. Each direction takes samples 0 through 31
within its own eight-frame interval; the next direction starts at sample 32.
The final quarter-frame therefore evaluates the current gait loop without
blending its rotation or materials toward the next direction/pass.

For each prepared scene, run inside the container:

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/legacy/usr/lib qemu-i386 /opt/blender/blender \
  -b /work/scenes32/worker-walk.blend -a
```

Repeat for the other six names from `scenes32/manifest.json`. Rendered recolorable
frames run from 0004 through 0259; where present, shadow frames run from 0260
through 0515. Render jobs may run independently. A source-density baseline can
also be prepared with `--samples 1`.

With Pillow and NumPy installed in a host Python environment, collect into a
**staging directory**, using a checkout/copy of the original 448-frame asset set
as the reference:

```sh
python3 tools/unit-animation/render.py collect \
  --rendered /path/to/work/render32 --output /path/to/work/staged \
  --reference /path/to/original/data/gfx
```

This validates every input image's size and RGBA mode, preserves its PNG bytes,
and writes a per-frame comparison report for every fourth new pose. Review that
report and composited direction/phase sheets before installation:

```sh
python3 tools/unit-animation/render.py install --staged /path/to/work/staged
```

The installer validates the complete filename set before packing it into sheets
and removes the per-frame layout. It does not install the JSON report or change
`unitmini*.png`.

The expanded layout has 1,792 consecutive recolorable frames and 1,024 shadow
frames. Action bases in unit types and saves keep their existing values;
`unitAnimationFrame` maps them to the render-only fourfold layout. Direction 8
retains its eight-direction turning cadence. The credits retain their existing
walk-cycle duration.

## Sheets

Installation packs the frames into one sheet per set and layer, sixteen tiles to
a row, and writes `data/gfx/unit.sheet` next to them. Each line of that index
names a sheet, the layer it fills (`image` for the shadow pass, `rotated` for
the recolorable one), the first frame, the frame count, and the tile size; the
column count follows from the sheet's width. `GAGCore::Sprite::load` reads the
index when it exists and cuts the tiles out itself, and falls back to the
`<name><i>.png` / `<name><i>r.png` layout when it does not, so sprites that ship
one file per frame keep working unchanged.

Eleven sheets replace 2,816 files. One deflate window across a whole animation
compresses about 20% better than the same frames stored separately, and the
frames stop paying a 4 KB filesystem block each.

## Checks

Run `python3 tools/unit-animation/test_render.py` with Pillow installed to test
scene preparation, sheet packing, and rejection of an incomplete install.
`UnitAnimationTest` is included in the C++ TestsRunner and exhaustively checks
frame ranges and turning cadence. `scons unit-blur-tests` builds
`UnitSpriteSheetCheck`, which cuts synthetic sheets of known pixels, exercises
the per-frame fallback, and checks the shipped unit set's frame count, layers,
and tile sizes. Compare alpha separately from RGB when reviewing the generated
report: geometry/coverage matching and subtle shading differences are distinct.
