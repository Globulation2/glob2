Description: Glob2 is a state of the art Real Time Strategy (RTS) game.
 Globulation in a whole is an on-going project to create an innovative high 
 quality gameplay by minimizing micro-managment and assigning automatically 
 the tasks to the units. The player just has to order the number of units 
 he wants for a selected task and the units will do their best to satisfy 
 your requirements.
 Glob2 can be played by a single player, through your Local Area Network (LAN), 
 or through Internet thanks to Ysagoon Online Game (YOG), a meta-server. It 
 also features a scripting language for versatile gameplay and an integrated 
 map editor.
