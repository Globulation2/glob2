glob2 (0.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (beta 3).  Main changes are:
    - Better unit movement: forbidden areas, enhanced warrior movement, units
      can go backwards.
    - Better flag/area functionality: clearing areas call proper units,
      forbidden areas are now respected. 
    - Many improvments to Nicowar's stability and performance.
    - Script text is now added to the history box ('h').
    - Tutorial text updated.

      in the game file.

          for testing features or AI's.
        * -test-games-nox: Same as -test-games, but without a GUI, so many
          times faster, but harder to knnow if features are working as they

glob2 (0.9.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Agh.  Globulation 2 keeps doing the same thing again and again, and I keep
    hating Scons more and more every day.  Removed the build directory from
    build target in debian/rules and wrote a simple install script to avoid
    the broken install script in Scons that tries to build again the binary,
    this time with the wrong path (closes: #477365).

    original tar.gz.
  * debian/rules: Added patch/unpatch targets from quilt.
  * debian/control: Added quilt and libfribidi-dev to Build-Depends.

    opposite is an abbreviation for 'high quality graphics'.

glob2 (0.8.21-4) unstable; urgency=medium
